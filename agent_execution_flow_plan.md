# Plan: Enhancing the Excel Agent Execution Flow for Robustness and Simplicity

## 1. Fix Syntax Error

- **Problem:** The Agent definition in `src/agent_core.py` is missing a closing parenthesis, causing a SyntaxError.
- **Solution:** Add the closing parenthesis after the agent definition to ensure the file is syntactically correct.

---

## 2. Refine Agent Prompt for Robustness

- **Emphasize:**
  - Dynamic intent and entity extraction from user instructions.
  - Multi-pass, iterative tool use (agentic loop).
  - Proactive, but minimal, clarifying questions (only when execution is impossible).
  - Default assumptions for common tasks (e.g., standard columns for tables).
  - Never call tools with empty or invalid data.

- **Prompt Example (to be updated in code):**
  - "Parse user instructions dynamically, extracting intent and entities. Use available tools in multiple passes as needed to achieve the goal. Only ask clarifying questions if absolutely necessary. Favor default assumptions for common tasks. Never call tools with empty or invalid data."

---

## 3. Ensure Tool Robustness

- **Review all tool functions** (in `tools.py` and `excel_ops.py`) to:
  - Validate input before execution.
  - Return clear errors if called with empty/invalid data.
  - Handle diverse and unpredictable input gracefully.

## 4. Improved Agent Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Receive User Instruction] --> B{Can intent/entities be extracted?}
    B -- Yes --> C[Plan actions and call tools (multi-pass)]
    C --> D{Is more info needed to proceed?}
    D -- No --> E[Complete task and report actions]
    D -- Yes --> F[Ask minimal clarifying question]
    F --> G[Receive user response]
    G --> C
    B -- No --> F
```

- **Key Points:**
  - The agent should always attempt to extract intent/entities and proceed.
  - Only ask for clarification if truly blocked.
  - Use multi-pass tool calls to iteratively achieve the goal.
  - Report concise, non-conversational results.

## 5. Implementation Steps

1. Fix the syntax error in `src/agent_core.py`.
2. Update the agent's prompt to reinforce robust, dynamic, and simple behavior.
3. Audit tool functions for input validation and error handling.
4. Test with diverse, complex, and ambiguous instructions to ensure robustness.
5. Iterate based on observed agent behavior.
