+In the "Total Sales" column (Column E), add a formula for each row to calculate Units Sold * Unit Price (e.g., in E2, the formula should be =C2*D2). Apply this formula down the column for all data rows in the table.

+
+Finally, merge cells A1:E1 and add the title "Sales Summary Report - Q1" centered horizontally and vertically within the merged cell. Make the title font size 14 and bold.

+Assuming the "Sales_Summary" sheet from the previous task exists and contains the sales data table:
+
+1.  **Create Named Range:** On the "Sales_Summary" sheet, define a workbook-level named range called "SalesDataTable" that refers to the data area of the table (likely `Sales_Summary!A2:E7`, excluding the header row and title).
+
+2.  **New Sheet:** Create a new worksheet named "Regional_Analysis".
+
+3.  **Analysis Table Setup:** On the "Regional_Analysis" sheet, starting in cell A1, set up the following headers: "Region", "Total Units Sold", "Average Unit Price". Make this header row bold.
+
+4.  **Populate Regions:** In cell A2 of "Regional_Analysis", list the unique regions found in the "Region" column (Column B) of the "SalesDataTable" on the "Sales_Summary" sheet. List each unique region only once (e.g., North, South, West, East).
+
+5.  **Calculate Aggregations:**
+    * In the "Total Units Sold" column (Column B on "Regional_Analysis", starting B2), enter a `SUMIF` formula for each region listed in Column A. This formula should sum the "Units Sold" (Column C in "SalesDataTable") from "Sales_Summary" sheet where the "Region" (Column B in "SalesDataTable") matches the region in the current row on "Regional_Analysis". Try using the named range "SalesDataTable" in your formula if possible (e.g., referencing columns within it).
+    * In the "Average Unit Price" column (Column C on "Regional_Analysis", starting C2), enter an `AVERAGEIF` formula for each region. This formula should average the "Unit Price" (Column D in "SalesDataTable") from "Sales_Summary" where the "Region" matches the current row's region. Again, try using the named range "SalesDataTable".
+
+6.  **Formatting:**
+    * Format the "Total Units Sold" column as a Number with 0 decimal places.
+    * Format the "Average Unit Price" column as Currency using the "$" symbol with 2 decimal places.
+    * Autofit the widths of columns A, B, and C on the "Regional_Analysis" sheet.
+
+7.  **Title:** Merge cells A1:C1 on the "Regional_Analysis" sheet and add the title "Regional Sales Analysis". Center the title horizontally and vertically and make the font bold, size 14. (Note: This will overwrite the headers previously placed in A1:C1, so the table setup should start from A2 instead). Adjust the previous steps accordingly if placing the title first is better. *Self-correction: Setup the table starting from row 2 (A2:C2 headers) to accommodate the title in row 1.*
+
+8.  **Snapshot:** Take a workbook snapshot.
+
+9.  **Attempt Deletion:** Try to delete the original "Sales_Summary" sheet. Report the outcome (success or failure with error message).
